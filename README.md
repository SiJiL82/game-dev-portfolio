# Game Dev Portfolio

This project is a static HTML site that is used to showcase the projects I have been working on while learning C# and Unity game development.

## Features

- __Title Bar__
    - Main title for the site, presenting a quick, single statement to the user describing what they can expect to see on the site.

- __Navigation Bar__
    - The responsive navigation bar is present on all pages, allowing consistent navigation between the main portfolio page, the "about me" page, and the contact form page.
    - This allows the user to access the main pages of the site without having to use browser navigation buttons.

    - The link to the currently active page is highlighted to the user with the link underlined, and when the user moves over the non-active links, they are highlighted in the same way, giving visual feedback that the link can be clicked and will become the new active link.  
    ![Navigation Bar Link Hover](readme-assets/images/nav-bar-hover.png)
    - A high contrast colour scheme and font size is used to allow easy readability for the user.

- __Portfolio Items__
    - This section presents the different portfolio items to the user.
    - A screenshot of the start screen is shown, followed by the title of the game, the date the game was published and a brief description of the game.
    ![Portfolio Item Overview](readme-assets/images/portfolio-item-overview.png)
    - A "More details" button under each item's description takes the user to the dedicated page for that game.
    - This button features a high contrast underline on the text when the user hovers over it, providing visual feedback that it can be clicked on.
