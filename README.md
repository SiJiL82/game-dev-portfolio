# Game Dev Portfolio

This project is a static HTML site that is used to showcase the projects I have been working on while learning C# and Unity game development.

## Features

- __Title Bar__
    - Main title for the site, presenting a quick, single statement to the user describing what they can expect to see on the site.

- __Navigation Bar__
    - The responsive navigation bar is present on all pages, allowing consistent navigation between the main portfolio page, the "about me" page, and the contact form page.
    - This allows the user to access the main pages of the site without having to use browser navigation buttons.
    - A high contrast colour scheme and font size is used to allow easy readability for the user.
